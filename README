Installation

    git clone git://github.com/kevinbowen777/dotfiles.git

Where possible, Vim plugins are installed as git submodules. Check these out by
running the commands:

    cd dotfiles
    git submodule init
    git submodule update

Create symlinks:

    ln -s ~/dotfiles/bash/bashrc ~/.bashrc
    ln -s ~/dotfiles/vim/vimrc ~/.vimrc
    ln -s ~/dotfiles/vim/gvimrc ~/.gvimrc
    ln -s ~/dotfiles/vim ~/.vim
    ln -s ~/dotfiles/tmux/tmux.conf ~/.tmux.conf

I put Vim's backup and swap files in `~/tmp`, so that directory must exist. To
be sure, run: 

    mkdir ~/tmp
    mkdir ~/tmp/.backup
    mkdir ~/tmp/.swp
    mkdir ~/tmp/.undo
      
# VIM #

My preferences for Vim are stored in `dotfiles/vim/vimrc` and `dotfiles/vim/gvimrc`
respectively. All plugins and scripts are stored in the `dotfiles/vim`
directory.

# Powerline plug-in installation
The current vim configuration depends upon havin the powerline plug-in
installed. The .bashrc and .tmux.conf files have the necessary code to run with
powerline; but, they are currently commented out.

To install powerline:
	sudo pip install git+git://github.com/Lokaltog/powerline

## Adding Plugin Bundles ##

Plugins that are published on github can be installed as submodules. For
example, to install the [Nerdtree bundle][ntree], follow these steps:

    cd ~/dotfiles
    git submodule add http://github.com/scrooloose/nerdtree.git/
vim/bundle/nerdtree 

This will update the `.gitmodules` file by appending something like:

    [submodule "vim/bundle/nerdtree"]
        path = vim/bundle/nerdtree
        url = http://github.com/scrooloose/nerdtree.git
    
As well as checkout out the git repo into the
`vim/bundle/nerdtree` directory. You can then commit these changes
as follows:

    git add .
    git commit -m "Added the nerdtree plug-in 
    git push origin master




[ntree]: http://github.com/scrooloose/nerdtree.git
